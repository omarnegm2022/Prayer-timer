With success granted by Allah, I managed to convert the **calendar of fasting(during Ramadan) 2025** for **Tanta** to an electronic version as Google events, with a reminder 4 minutes before each prayer:
<br>
x [Ø¥Ù…Ø³Ø§ÙƒÙŠØ© Ø±Ù…Ø¶Ø§Ù† 2025](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y2UxNDA1OGI2OTc2OWY2ZTRjNmQyNDE1ODJjYzdhZWMxMjIwN2VmYTA5MDQ1MWIzOGMyYTAyNjY3NzMwODI4Y0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) <br>with a description of: (fasting hours, time and the pre-meal time)
<br>
, using the following tools:
<br>
-JSON: 
copying and pasting times in objects nested as (Week_No, Day_Name, Subject, Date, Start & End Time, and Description)
Note: Sunrise with End time is mentioned for the forenoon(Ø§Ù„Ø¶Ø­Ù‰) prayer.<br>
-Python: <br>
to read the JSON file and print the dictionary content in the form of schema described in the...
-SQL Server: <br>
to create a table of content retrieved through JSON, that is eventually used in...
-Excel: <br>
to format the CSV file so Google could understand its content to be added as events to the calendar.
<br>
I'm happy for any contribution ^^ and recommendations
<br>
Although I could simply do it in one way just using Excel, but I decided to make it with these tools for learning, and also all of them are essential tools for my career, aren't they?ðŸ˜€
