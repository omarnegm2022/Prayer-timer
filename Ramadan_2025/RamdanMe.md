, using the following tools:

-JSON: 
copying and pasting times in objects nested as (Week_No, Day_Name, Subject, Date, Start & End time, and Description)
Note: Sunrise with End time is mentioned for the forenoon(Ø§Ù„Ø¶Ø­Ù‰) prayer.
-Python: 
to read the JSON file and print the dictionary content in the form of schema described in the...
-SQL server: 
to create a table of content retrieved through json, that is eventually used in...
-Excel: 
to format csv file as Google could understand its content to be added as events to the calendar.

Expect a repository in GitHub for this service, soon!
I'm happy for any contribution ^^ and recommendations

Although I could simply do it in one way just using Excel, but I decided to make it with these tools for learning, and also all of them are essential tools for my career, aren't they?ðŸ˜€
